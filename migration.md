# Ergo Explorer MCP Migration Guide

This document outlines the steps needed to remove deprecated functionality and clean up the codebase to improve maintainability and reduce errors.

**Current Status (as of last update):** Proceeding with Phase 4 - Removal of Deprecated Components. Internal code references have been checked and updated where necessary. Deprecation warnings are in place. Ready to remove the deprecated file and associated registration.

## Overview of Deprecated Components

1. **Deprecated API Routes** (`ergo_explorer/api/routes/deprecated.py`) - **TARGET FOR REMOVAL**
   - Several outdated API endpoints that redirect to newer implementations or have updated logic.
   - Contained errors (e.g., address balance function, import issues) which have been addressed.

2. **Monolithic Token Holders Implementation** (`ergo_explorer/tools/token_holders.py`) - **TARGET FOR REMOVAL**
   - Legacy file acting as a compatibility layer.
   - The implementation has been moved to `ergo_explorer/tools/token_holders/` package.

3. **Import References**
   - Many files previously imported from deprecated paths.
   - These have been checked and updated to use the new module structure where necessary.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Immediate Issues - COMPLETE

1. **Fix Address Balance Implementation** - **DONE**
   - Corrected `get_address_balance` in `deprecated.py` to use the proper underlying function before removal.
   - Fixed import errors for `get_info`, `get_mining_difficulty`, `get_network_hashrate`.

2. **Create a New Address Info Tool** - **DONE**
   - Comprehensive `blockchain_address_info` tool created in `blockchain.py`.
   - `blockchain_status` tool created for network/node info.

### Phase 2: Update Import References - COMPLETE

1. **Inventory Import References** - **DONE**
   - Codebase scanned (`grep -r "from ergo_explorer.tools.token_holders import"`, `grep` for deprecated tool calls).
   - Internal references checked and confirmed to be using newer implementations (e.g., `blockchain.py` uses `tools.address.get_address_balance`).

2. **Update Documentation** - **PENDING (Manual Step)**
   - README.md and other documentation need final updates to remove references to deleted tools and confirm replacements.

### Phase 3: Add Proper Deprecation Warnings - COMPLETE

1. **Modify Deprecated Functions** - **DONE**
   - Clear deprecation warnings (`warnings.warn`) added to all functions in `deprecated.py`.
   - Logging warnings added.

### Phase 4: Remove Deprecated Components - IN PROGRESS

1. **Create a Cleanup Branch** - **ASSUMED (User's current branch)**
   - Recommended branch name: `cleanup/remove-deprecated-components`

2. **Verify No Internal Usage** - **DONE**
   - Confirmed that no internal code calls the deprecated tool functions directly.

3. **Remove Deprecated Route Registration** - **DONE**
   - Located the call to `register_deprecated_routes` in `ergo_explorer/api/routes/__init__.py`.
   - Removed the import and the function call.
   - Deleted the associated test file `tests/api/test_deprecated_routes.py`.

4. **Remove `deprecated.py`** - **DONE**
   - Deleted the file `ergo_explorer/api/routes/deprecated.py`.

5. **Remove `token_holders.py`** - **DONE**
   - Verified no remaining imports from `ergo_explorer.tools.token_holders`.
   - Deleted the legacy file `ergo_explorer/tools/token_holders.py`.

6. **Update and Test Documentation** - **PENDING (Manual Step)**
   - Ensure all documentation (e.g., README.md) is updated to reflect the removal and points to the new tools.
   - Manual testing recommended post-migration.
