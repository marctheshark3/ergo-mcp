## Implementation Notes

- **Explorer API Integration**: Core features rely on the Ergo Explorer API for blockchain data.
- **Node API Requirements**: Features requiring Node API access will need direct access to an Ergo node.
- **DEX Integrations**: Price and liquidity features will require integration with Spectrum and/or ErgoDEX APIs.
- **Oracle Pool**: Oracle-related features will need integration with the Oracle Pool API.
- **Custom Analytics**: Advanced features marked with "Custom" require development of custom algorithms.
- **Infrastructure**: Ongoing work includes comprehensive automated testing and performance optimization.

## Sub-Phase Priorities Reasoning

1. **Phase 2A**: Focus on infrastructure improvements and optimizations that will benefit all future work. Completed token and address features will be revisited to ensure they align with the new optimizations.

2. **Phase 2B**: Introduce analytics capabilities for tokens and addresses that provide immediate value while building on the foundations established in 2A.

3. **Phase 2C**: Implement more complex features that require integration with external systems (DEXes, oracles) and advanced analytics that depend on the analytical framework from 2B.

## Progress Tracking

As features are implemented, update their status in the tables above using one of these values:
- To Do
- In Progress
- Testing
- Completed

## Technical Requirements

- Response time < 2 seconds for standard queries
- Support for concurrent requests (minimum 10 simultaneous users)
- Graceful degradation under heavy load
- Efficient caching of frequently requested data
- Optimized data handling for large result sets
