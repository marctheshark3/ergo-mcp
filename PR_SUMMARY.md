# Deprecation Cleanup PR Summary

## Overview

This PR implements the first phase of the migration plan outlined in `migration.md` to gradually phase out deprecated components. The main goal is to make the codebase more maintainable and reduce errors by properly updating import paths and providing clear deprecation warnings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New `blockchain_address_info` Tool

Added a comprehensive replacement for the deprecated `get_address_balance` function:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def blockchain_address_info(ctx: Context, address: str, include_transactions: bool = True, tx_limit: int = 10) -> str:
    """
    Get comprehensive address information including balance, tokens, and recent transactions.
    """
```

This new tool:
- Combines balance and transaction history information
- Offers options to customize the response
- Follows a more logical API structure

### 2. Fixed Incorrect Import in Deprecated Functions

- Updated the address balance implementation to correctly use the address module
- Deprecated code was incorrectly redirecting to the token holders function

### 3. Added Proper Deprecation Warnings

- Added Python's built-in `warnings.warn()` calls to all deprecated functions
- Improved documentation with clear migration paths
- Set stack level correctly for better warning traces

### 4. Updated Import References in Tests

- Fixed tests to import directly from the proper submodule (e.g., `token_holders.holders`)
- Kept test functionality intact while aligning with new package structure

## Testing

The changes have been tested by:
1. Building a new Docker image
2. Testing address balance lookup
3. Testing the new blockchain_address_info endpoint
4. Verifying deprecation warnings are shown appropriately

## Next Steps

This PR implements Phase 1 of the migration plan. Future phases will include:
1. Updating more import references throughout the codebase
2. Adding deprecation timelines to warnings
3. Eventually removing the deprecated components in a future major release
